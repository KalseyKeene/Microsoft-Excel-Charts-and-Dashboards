Creating Charts and Dashboards in Excel

About This Project

In this guided project, I learned how to create charts in Microsoft Excel to analyze sales data from a sample company. I used PivotTables to assess various aspects of the sales information and represented the data through line, bar, and pie charts. I also formatted the charts for clarity and assembled them into a dashboard to provide a comprehensive overview of the sales performance.
